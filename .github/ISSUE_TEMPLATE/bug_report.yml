        **Thank you for wanting to report a bug in Pi Support!**

          * First, be sure you are running the [latest version of the Pi Support plugin](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-PiSupport/releases).
          * You will also need to [enable debug logging on the plugin](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/configuration/logging_yaml.html).
            * This may be done through the *Settings* > *OctoPrint* > *Logging* > *Logging Levels* section.
            * Select the `octoprint.plugins.pi_support` name, and make sure Level is "DEBUG".
            * Save, then restart OctoPrint, which allows the developers to see debug information from the moment the plugin is loaded.
          * Finally, when submitting a bug report, you **must** [include a Systeminfo Bundle](https://community.octoprint.org/t/what-is-a-systeminfo-bundle-and-how-can-i-obtain-one/29887), generated after the point the bug occurs. This allows the developers to examine the debug logs produced from your plugin installation.

        Thank you for your help!

          * Systeminfo Bundle: See [here](https://community.octoprint.org/t/what-is-a-systeminfo-bundle-and-how-can-i-obtain-one/29887) if you don't know where to find that. Just attach down below as-is.
            * If you are reporting an issue that involves communicating with you printer, **be sure to enable `serial.log` before reproducing and creating the Systeminfo Bundle**!
          * Your browser's JavaScript console, if you are reporting a problem with the user interface. See [here](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers) on where to find that.
          * If possible, screenshots or videos showing the problem, especially if you are reporting a problem with the user interface!
          * GCODE files with which to reproduce.

        Please be aware that unless at least Systeminfo Bundle is included, your bug report
        will not be processed and closed after a while.
